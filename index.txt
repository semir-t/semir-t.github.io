About me

I am versatile, creative, hardworking and a quick learner with a solid foundation in Embedded Systems and Computer Architecture. I hold Bachelor's degree in Electrical engineering from the University of Tuzla and for the last 2 years I am working full time as an Embedded system designer at IRQdesign d.o.o. 

My field of interest include: 
 - Bare-metal firmware development
 - High-level firmware development
 - PCB design
 - System control theory
 - Image processing
 - Network and communication protocols
 - Data structures
 
I have experience designing and developing firmware from low level drivers to system application on different MCUs (STM,Atmel,Microchip,TI etc.). Experience with all common MCU peripherals such as
UART, SPI, I2C, DMA, ADC,DAC, RTC, Timers, USB, CAN, etc.

In last couple of years I have worked with various MCUs and some of them have following characteristics:
 - Based on the ARM Cortex M0,M1,M3,M4,M7 processor
 - 8 bit and 32 bit MCUs
 - Dual core MCU (STM32H7x7, STM32H7x5) 

As new ICs are coming to the market there is always a need to write custom drivers, and in the last couple of years I gain experience in writing drivers and libraries for
 - different kind of sensors (temperature,accelerometers, pressure etc.)
 - motor drivers (stepper motors, BLDC, DC, Servo)
 - displays (LCD and TFT)
 - MMC/SD cards
 - GSM Modules

When designing a product, firmware is just one side of the story. For full device we need a dedicated hardware, and my experience in this are is:
 - PCB design using Eagle CAD and KiCAD
 - Soldering board with components that have following packages: LQFP, QFN, BGA,SOT, 0402 etc.
 - Hardware functionality testing
 - In-House EMC testing for the custom hardware

When it comes to my filed of interest, I am always looking to learn and improve but also I like to share my knowledge. Because of that I am working part-time as a teaching assistant on Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Tuzla.

My hobbies are running and photography.
